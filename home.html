        The purpose of this site is to provide a resource for training for the
        AMC 10 by solving problems on a realistic testing interface similar to
        the contest.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spirit of being as realistic as possible to the real contest, you
        <b>cannot</b> pause or exit the test and come back later; the problem
        set you chose must be completed in block.
      </p>
      <p>To get started, pick a problem set below.</p>

      <h1>About the AMC 10</h1>
      <p>
        The AMC 10, administered by the Mathematical Association of America
        (MAA) is a 25-question, 75-minute multiple-choice exam focused on
        utilizing high school mathematics up to 10th grade level to solve
        problems centered around demonstrating strong problem-solving and
        critial thinking skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        The AMC 10 is the gateway exam to farther mathematical opportunities,
        the most immediate being the American Invitational Mathematics
        Examination (AIME). Around the top 6% scorers of the AMC 10 are invited
        to take the AIME. Good scoring in both the AMC 10 and AIME leads to the
        qualification for the prestigious United States of America Junior
        Mathematics Olympiad (USAJMO), which opens one's path to many more
        mathematical opportunities in competition.
