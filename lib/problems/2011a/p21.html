<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Problem_21">Problem 21</span></h2> <p>Two counterfeit coins of equal weight are mixed with 8 identical genuine coins. The weight of each of the counterfeit coins is different from the weight of each of the genuine coins. A pair of coins is selected at random without replacement from the 10 coins. A second pair is selected at random without replacement from the remaining 8 coins. The combined weight of the first pair is equal to the combined weight of the second pair. What is the probability that all 4 selected coins are genuine? </p><p><img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/5/c/f5c10b21992ae4d8872fa4efcecb3fd19dc3c4fd.png" class="latex" alt="$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{7}{11}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{9}{13}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{11}{15}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{15}{19}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{15}{16}$" style="vertical-align: -13px" width="413" height="38" /> </p><p><a
