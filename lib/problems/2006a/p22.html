<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Problem_22">Problem 22</span></h2> <p>Two farmers agree that pigs are worth &#36;300 and that goats are worth &#36;210. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with "change" received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a &#36;390 debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way? </p><p><img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/0/1/5/015f03fefa36dc9d4fc945d6c0e28e6147f77dd1.png" class="latex" alt="$\mathrm{(A)}\ 5\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 10\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 30\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 90\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 210$" style="vertical-align: -4px" width="387" height="18" /> </p><p><a
