<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Problem_23">Problem 23</span></h2> <p>Rachel and Robert run on a circular track. Rachel runs counterclockwise and completes a lap every 90 seconds, and Robert runs clockwise and completes a lap every 80 seconds. Both start from the same line at the same time. At some random time between 10 minutes and 11 minutes after they begin to run, a photographer standing inside the track takes a picture that shows one-fourth of the track, centered on the starting line. What is the probability that both Rachel and Robert are in the picture? </p><p><img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/b/4/3b447891e791897b92c1f65fdc3e506474e4d599.png" class="latex" alt="$\text{(A) } \frac 1{16} \qquad \text{(B) } \frac 18 \qquad \text{(C) } \frac 3{16} \qquad \text{(D) } \frac 14 \qquad \text{(E) } \frac 5{16}$" style="vertical-align: -13px" width="376" height="38" /> </p><p><a
