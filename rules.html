        The exam is a 25 question multiple choice test with five options labeled
        A through E. You will be given <b>75 minutes</b> to complete the test.
      </p>
      <p>
        Points are <i>not</i> calculated in a binary fasion: incorrect answers
        will be penalized. Specificially, a correct answer is worth
        <b>6 points</b>, a blank answer is worth <b>1.5 points</b>, and an
        incorrect answer is <b>0 points</b>. Thus the maximum score that can be
        obtained is 150 points. Note that blank answers were worth 2 points in
        2006 and 2007, and 2.5 points prior to 2006.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the competition, you are only allowed to use the following items:

        <ul>
          <li>Writing utensils (e.g. pencils, pens, erasers)</li>
          <li>Blank or lined scratch paper</li>
          <li>Graph paper</li>
          <li>Ruler</li>
          <li>Compass</li>
        </ul>

        Note that exams prior to 2006 permit the use of calculators accepted on
        the SAT, though no problem requires the use of a calculator.
      </p>
      <p>
        When using the mock testing interface, you <i>cannot</i> pause or exit
        the test or your progress will be lost. Your test will automatically be
        submitted when the timer runs out, but can also be submitted early.
